This is a top level repository for code examples related to Data Warehousing and Very Large Databases.

There are examples and scripts relating to the Oracle Database and, in particular, the Oracle Optimizer. 

The examples are generally self-contained, each in a directory containing all the scripts you'll need to complete a particular example. The scripts can be executed using SQL Plus or <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html">Oracle SQL Developer.</a>

Many of the scripts are referenced from the Oracle Optimizer Blog, here: https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer
