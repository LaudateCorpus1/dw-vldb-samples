<h2>Make external tables to load TPC-DS data</h2>

Run the tpcds_makex.sql in your TPC-DS schema at it will spool a new script called tpcds_etabs.sql. This spooled script will create a bunch of external tables enabling you to load the TPC-DS files generated by dsdgen.

The example tpcds_etabs.sql script works for TPC-DS v1.4. For other versions, just run tpcds_makex.sql to create a new tpcds_etabs.sql file.

If you leave the script unedited, you just create a symbolic link "/tmp/tpcdsload" pointing to the directory containing all of your dsdgen files.
