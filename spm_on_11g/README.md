<h2>SQL Plan Management Examples</h2>

Some scripts on the subject of SQL Plan Management in Oracle 11gR2. I have include spooled output in "lst" files so you can see how the scripts can be used. View in order: "introduction", "evolve" and "sts".


DISCLAIMER:
   <br/>-- These scripts are provided for educational purposes only.
   <br/>-- They are NOT supported by Oracle World Wide Technical Support.
   <br/>-- The scripts have been tested and they appear to work as intended.
   <br/>-- You should always run scripts on a test instance.
<br/>
WARNING:
   <br/>-- "drop.sql" will drop all SQL Plan Baselines
